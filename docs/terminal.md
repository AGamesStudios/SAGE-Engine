# SAGE Terminal

The terminal provides a simple command prompt for running scripts and managing a project.
Run it with:

```bash
python -m sage_engine.terminal
```

Available commands:
- `run <file>` — execute a `.sage_fs`, `.lua` or `.py` script
- `exit` — close the terminal

More features will be added in future versions.
