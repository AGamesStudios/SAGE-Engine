# Audit 0.3 Results

During the stabilization sprint for Alpha 0.3 all subsystems were reviewed to ensure they can run together without conflicts or crashes.

## Inspection Summary
- Verified boot order and hot reset of the core subsystems.
- Checked render batching and camera updates across window resizes.
- Exercised the scene DAG and object callbacks via the examples.
- Tested event filters and asynchronous handlers.
- Inspected resource loading for leaks and dangling references.
- Confirmed Draw, Gizmo and Featherâ€‘FX remain optional modules.

## Fixes and Improvements
- Removed stale code paths and guarded exception cases in the scene loader.
- Normalised the API surface of Lua and Python runners.
- Cleaned up unused event handlers during `cleanup_events()`.
- Added memory checks in the core boot sequence.

## Conclusion
All tests pass under `ruff` and `pytest`. The engine boots cleanly, reloads scripts on the fly and shuts down without memory leaks. Subsystems have minimal coupling and can be extended via plugins.
