# Alpha 0.3 Audit

This audit summarises the status of SAGE Engine following the development cycle leading to Alpha 0.3. All subsystems were inspected and exercised via the included examples and automated tests.

## Core and Boot
- `core_boot` initialises the window, render, framesync, time, input, resource, object, DAG and UI subsystems in sequence.
- `core_reset` cleanly shuts down each subsystem and supports hot reinitialisation.
- Boot profiling prints the startup time of each subsystem.

## Resources
- `.sage_object` files load from `data/objects` and populate the scene automatically.
- FlowScript (`.sage_fs`), Lua and Python scripts load from `data/scripts` and can be hot reloaded by `ScriptsWatcher`.
- A low performance mode can be enabled with `--low-perf` for weak devices.

## Scene and Objects
- Objects maintain `parent_id` links and caches by role and layer.
- `on_scene_enter` and `on_scene_exit` callbacks fire when objects are added or removed.

## Rendering and Window
- The window subsystem now uses a custom implementation and dispatches resize/close events.
- The render module batches sprites by image and falls back to a placeholder when an image is missing.
- Example project confirms sprites render correctly to the real window.

## Input and Time
- Keyboard and mouse state are tracked with event emission on changes.
- `time.get_delta()` and `framesync.regulate()` provide stable frame timing.

## Events
- Lightweight dispatcher with `on`, `once`, `emit` and `off`. Dead handlers are cleaned via `cleanup_events`.

## Logic
- FlowScript supports variables, arithmetic and scene manipulation; the grammar is configurable via YAML modules.
- Lua and Python scripts have access to the same logic API and can be hot reloaded.

## Examples and Tests
`examples/multi_script` loads FlowScript, Lua and Python together.
`examples/camera_follow` demonstrates camera tracking.
Automated test suite (`pytest -q`) covers all subsystems; `ruff` ensures style compliance.

## Files Included
- Source code: `.py` modules under `sage_engine`, `sage`, `sage_fs` and `sage_object`.
- Configuration: `.yaml` files in `sage/config` and `examples`.
- Scripts: `.sage_fs`, `.lua` and `.py` examples.
- No binary assets other than empty placeholders tracked via `.gitkeep`.

No blocking issues were found. All subsystems operate without crashes or memory leaks during prolonged runs, and the engine is ready for further development beyond Alpha 0.3.
