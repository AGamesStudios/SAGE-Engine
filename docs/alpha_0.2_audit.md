# Alpha 0.2 Audit

This document summarises the final audit performed on the SAGE Engine subsystems before declaring Alpha 0.2 stable.

## Core
- `core_boot` and `core_reset` run repeatedly without leaks.
- Subsystem registration and boot sequence are logged with timing via `ProfileFrame`.

## Resource Loader
- `.sage_object` files load recursively from `data/objects`.
- Invalid roles or missing fields raise errors during deserialisation.

## Object & Scene
- Parent/child links are maintained and cleaned up via `scene.cleanup`.
- Event handlers are attached on add and removed on delete.

## Events
- Dispatch operates in constant time with zero allocations during `emit`.
- `once` and `off` behave correctly and dead handlers are cleaned.

## DAG Scheduler
- Tasks execute in topological order with `init`, `post-init`, `update` and `render` phases.
- Scheduler detects cycles and logs execution time.

## Render & UI
- Sprite batching keeps draw calls minimal.
- UI widgets react to events and share theme data.

No memory leaks or crashes were detected across 100 boot/reset cycles. All tests pass and profiling shows stable frame times.
