# Examples

The repository includes a few small demos showcasing different features of the engine.

## Alpha Demo

Demonstrates the low-level ChronoPatch API and MicroPython bindings. Run it with:

```bash

```bash
python examples/example_project/main.py
```

## Basic Display

Shows a UI label and camera using FlowScript.

```bash
python examples/basic_display/main.py
```

## Object Control

Move a sprite with arrow keys via Lua.

```bash
python examples/object_control/main.py
```

## Multi Script

Loads FlowScript, Lua and Python at once.

```bash
python examples/multi_script/main.py
```
