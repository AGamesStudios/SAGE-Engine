## [Early Alpha] - 2025-01-07

First public release of SAGE Engine. This is experimental software.

### What Works
- Application lifecycle (OnInit, OnUpdate, OnRender, OnShutdown)
- Window creation with GLFW
- 2D batch rendering with OpenGL 3.3+
- Keyboard and mouse input
- Basic collision detection (AABB)
- Texture loading and rendering
- Sound playback (multi-channel)
- Logging system with printf formatting
- Math utilities (Vector2, Rect, Transform)
- CMake build system
- Standalone EXE builds (Windows)

### Known Issues
- Logger UTF-8 console output has encoding issues on some systems
- Renderer Init() may be called twice (warning shown)
- Collision detection fails with fast-moving objects
- No 3D rendering support
- No visual editor
- Documentation incomplete
- Test coverage partial
- Linux/macOS builds not thoroughly tested

### Limitations
- 2D only (no 3D)
- No ECS architecture yet
- No sprite animation system
- No tilemap support
- No scene serialization
- No networking
- No scripting integration
- Small community

### Examples Included
- SimpleGame - Basic engine usage
- PongTest - Full game example testing core features

### Build System
- CMake 3.20+ required
- MSVC 2019+, GCC 9+, Clang 10+ supported
- SAGE_STATIC_BUILD option for standalone executables
- Cross-platform (Windows tested, Linux/macOS experimental)

### Dependencies
- GLFW 3.3.8 (windowing)
- GLAD (OpenGL loader)
- stb_image (image loading)
- miniaudio (audio playback)

### License
MIT License - Free for commercial and personal use

## Alpha Development Notes

**Current Status**: This engine is in **early alpha**. It is **not production-ready**.

### What Works
- ‚úÖ Basic window creation and event handling
- ‚úÖ Simple 2D sprite rendering
- ‚úÖ Basic keyboard and mouse input
- ‚úÖ Math utilities (vectors, transforms)
- ‚úÖ Logging system
- ‚úÖ CMake build system

### What's Unstable
- üöß Advanced rendering features (particles, materials)
- üöß Physics system (collision detection unreliable)
- üöß Audio system (crashes possible)
- üöß Resource management (memory leaks possible)
- üöß UI system (very basic)
- üöß Gamepad input

### What's Missing
- ‚ùå Scene serialization
- ‚ùå Tilemap support
- ‚ùå Animation system
- ‚ùå Networking
- ‚ùå Scripting support
- ‚ùå Advanced editor tools

**Recommendation**: Use for learning, prototyping, and experimentation only. Not suitable for production games.
