# Editor Overview

The SAGE Editor lets you place objects and manage scenes. Use the small toolbar in the top-left corner to switch between move, rotate, scale and rect modes.

The editor uses Qt's Fusion style with a dark palette. The viewport fills most
of the window while docks hold resources, objects and properties. Rect mode shows a bounding box with bright handles you can drag to move or resize objects. Hold **Shift** to keep the aspect ratio while resizing. The *View*
menu offers a **Mirror Resize** toggle that scales objects symmetrically.
Hotkeys Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V/Delete mirror the Edit menu actions. High-DPI scaling
keeps text readable. Use the **File** menu to open and save ``.sageproject``
files.
