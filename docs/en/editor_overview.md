# Editor Overview

The SAGE Editor lets you place objects and manage scenes. Use the toolbar to switch between move, rotate and scale modes.

The editor uses Qt's Fusion style with a dark palette. The viewport fills most
of the window while docks hold resources, objects and properties. High-DPI
scaling keeps text readable. Use the **File** menu to open and save
``.sageproject`` files.
