# Editor Overview

The SAGE Editor lets you place objects and manage scenes. Use the small toolbar in the top-left corner to switch between **Edit** and **Model** modes. In Edit mode the buttons select move, rotate, scale or rect tools. When the move tool is active a square between the arrows lets you drag objects along both axes. Model mode shows vertex points for mesh objects so shapes can be adjusted directly.

The editor uses the custom **SAGE Ember** style with a dark palette. The viewport fills most
of the window while docks hold resources, objects and properties. Rect mode shows a bounding box with bright handles you can drag to move or resize objects. Hold **Shift** to keep the aspect ratio while resizing. The *View*
menu offers a **Mirror Resize** toggle and a switch for **Local Coordinates**. Handles remain visible so you can keep editing even without the outline.
Hotkeys Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V/Delete mirror the Edit menu actions. High-DPI scaling
keeps text readable. Use the **File** menu to open and save ``.sageproject``
files.
