# Editor Overview

The SAGE Editor lets you place objects and manage scenes. Use the small toolbar in the top-left corner to switch between move, rotate and scale modes.

The editor uses Qt's Fusion style with a dark palette. The viewport fills most
of the window while docks hold resources, objects and properties. When an object
is selected its bounding box is drawn with bright handles you can drag to move
or resize it. Hold **Shift** to keep the aspect ratio while resizing. The *View*
menu offers a **Mirror Resize** toggle that scales objects symmetrically.
Hotkeys Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V/Delete mirror the Edit menu actions. High-DPI scaling
keeps text readable. Use the **File** menu to open and save ``.sageproject``
files.
