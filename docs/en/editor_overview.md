# Editor Overview

The SAGE Editor lets you place objects and manage scenes. Use the toolbar to switch between move, rotate and scale modes.

The default layout places the viewport in the centre of the window with the console directly beneath it. A Resources dock appears on the left, while the Object List and Properties docks are stacked on the right.
