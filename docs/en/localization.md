# Localization Guide

The editor can be translated by adding JSON files to `sage_editor/translations`.
Each file is named after the language and contains key/value pairs mapping the
original English text to its translation.

1. Copy `en.json` to `<Language>.json` and translate the values.
2. Launch the editor and choose the language from **Settings â†’ Language**.
3. No code changes are needed.

Contributors can share new language files without editing the engine itself.
