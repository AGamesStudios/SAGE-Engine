# Properties Window

This panel displays the properties of the selected object with a scroll area so
large sets of fields remain accessible. Changes take effect immediately when you
finish editing a value.

## Physics

If the optional physics module is installed, objects include a **Physics**
category. Physics support is experimental. Each object has two settings:

- **Enabled** &ndash; toggles physics on or off for the object.
- **Body Type** &ndash; choose **Static** or **Dynamic** behaviour.
