# Menu

The menu bar groups actions into several categories.

- **File** – open and save projects or capture screenshots.
- **Edit** – copy, paste and delete objects. These actions use the shortcuts
  Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V and Delete.
- **Engine** – pick the renderer or toggle the grid under *View*. The same menu
  lets you enable **Mirror Resize** for symmetrical scaling or hide the
  **Bounding Box** around selected objects.
- **About** – information about the editor.
