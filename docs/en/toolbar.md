# Toolbar

The toolbar sits vertically in the top-left corner and lets you switch between move, rotate, scale and rect tools as well as perform common actions. The move gizmo includes a small square between the arrows that lets you drag objects along both axes at once.
The *Screenshot* button opens a dialog for saving the current viewport as ``PNG``.
