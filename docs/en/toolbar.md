# Toolbar

The toolbar sits vertically in the top-left corner and starts with **Edit** and **Model** buttons. Edit mode exposes move, rotate, scale and rect tools while Model mode shows vertex handles for editing meshes. A **Local** toggle aligns gizmos to the object's rotation. The move gizmo includes a small square between the arrows that lets you drag objects along both axes at once.
Right-click the viewport to create sprites, empties, cameras or simple shapes.
The *Screenshot* button opens a dialog for saving the current viewport as ``PNG``.

Below the menu bar a compact toolbar provides quick toggle buttons for the grid,
rulers, cursor coordinates and local mode. Toolbars are fixed in place without
visible drag handles.
