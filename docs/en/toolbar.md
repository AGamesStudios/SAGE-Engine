# Toolbar

The toolbar sits vertically in the top-left corner and starts with **Edit** and **Model** buttons. Edit mode exposes move, rotate, scale and rect tools while Model mode shows vertex handles for editing meshes. A **Local** toggle aligns gizmos to the object's rotation. The move gizmo includes a small square between the arrows that lets you drag objects along both axes at once.
The *Screenshot* button opens a dialog for saving the current viewport as ``PNG``.
