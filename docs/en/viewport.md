# Viewport

The viewport shows the current scene using the OpenGL renderer.
Drag with the left mouse button to pan the camera, use the mouse wheel to zoom
and left click to select objects under the cursor.
Right clicking a selected object opens a menu with **Copy**, **Paste** and
**Delete** actions.  Right clicking empty space opens a menu to create a new
object at the cursor position.
