# SAGE Engine Alpha 1.0 Roadmap

This document tracks the remaining steps towards the Alpha 1.0 release. Each subsystem must be stable with at least one example and tests should pass on a clean environment.

- Fix failing tests and add missing dependencies.
- Replace audio stubs with real playback.
- Verify physics interactions and X-Ray overlay.
- Ensure render and UI examples display correctly.
- Document resources and plugin system.

When all items are checked off, the project graduates from "Alpha 1.0 Candidate" to "Alpha 1.0".
