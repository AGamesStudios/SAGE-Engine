**Date**: 2025-01-06

### 2. CHANGELOG.md - Honest Rewrite ✅

**Header:**
- Added prominent alpha status warning
- Removed semantic versioning adherence claim (not following semver yet)

**Version Sections:**
- ❌ Removed: "[0.1.0] - 2025-10-06" (fake release)
- ✅ Replaced with: "[Alpha] - Early Development (2025)"
- Changed all feature claims from "complete" to realistic status with emojis:

  - 🚧 Experimental (construction sign)

**Added New Sections:**
- **Known Issues (Alpha)** - Critical bugs, missing features, platform issues, API instability
- **Alpha Development Notes** - What works, what's unstable, what's missing
- Clear recommendation: "Use for learning, prototyping, and experimentation only. Not suitable for production games."

**Removed Sections:**
- Deleted fake "Release Notes" claiming production-ready status
- Removed "Highlights" claiming 100% test pass rate and production-ready systems

---

### 3. Git Tags - Corrected ✅

- Tag message: "Early Alpha Release - Unstable, expect bugs and breaking changes"

**Pushed to GitHub:**
- All changes committed and pushed to `main` branch

## What Still Needs Updating (Optional)

### Internal Documentation
These files reference v2.0.0 but are less critical (internal project tracking):

1. **.project/GITHUB_RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - References v2.0.0 in release creation steps
2. **.project/PUBLICATION_COMPLETE.md** - References v2.0.0 in summary
3. **.project/PUBLISHED_TO_GITHUB.md** - May reference version numbers

**Priority**: Low - These are internal tracking files, not user-facing.

### User Documentation
1. **docs/README.md** - Check if it needs alpha warnings (user made manual edits)
2. **docs/guides/** - Check individual guide files for version references

**Priority**: Medium - Should be updated if users will see them.

---

## Impact

**Before:**
- Engine claimed to be v2.0.0 production-ready
- Documentation promised advanced, complete features
- No warnings about bugs or breaking changes
- Build badge suggested everything was working perfectly

**After:**
- Engine honestly presented as early alpha
- Documentation clearly marks incomplete features
- Prominent warnings about bugs, instability, breaking changes
- Realistic expectations for users
- GitHub tag accurately reflects development stage

---

## Result

✅ **SAGE Engine is now honestly presented as an early alpha project.**

Users will now understand:
- This is experimental software
- Bugs and crashes are expected
- Features are incomplete
- Breaking changes will happen
- Not suitable for production games
- Perfect for learning and prototyping

This builds trust and sets correct expectations with potential users and contributors.
