## 🌿 Branch Strategy

### Current Branch: `rewrite/sage2d`
This is a **complete rewrite** branch that transforms SAGE Engine from a Python-based plugin system to a native C++ game engine.

### Next Steps

1. **Test the build** on different platforms
2. **Review and merge** into main branch when ready
3. **Tag a release** (e.g., v2.0.0)
4. **Update CI/CD** for automated builds
