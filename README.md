# SAGE Engine Example

This repository contains a minimal example of a Python renderer built with OpenGL.
The engine demonstrates baked global illumination using a light map. It now uses a
fixed camera so the scene is easier to view and enables multi-sample anti aliasing
for smoother edges.

 Shadows are rendered with a depth map and filtered using a 5x5 PCF kernel for
 softer edges. The engine now verifies that the shadow framebuffer is complete
 and uses a 32â€‘bit depth texture so shadows appear reliably. The scene is lit by
 two light sources plus an ambient term so objects are easier to see. The
 shaders combine the baked light map with dynamic lighting and shadowing to
 approximate global illumination.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyOpenGL
- A valid OpenGL context (GLUT)

Install the requirements with:

```bash
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
```

Then run the example:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will open a window with a plane and a rotating cube lit by two point
lights. The camera is fixed in place so the cube and plane remain in view. The
shaders apply a baked global illumination map, soft shadow mapping with PCF
filtering and gamma correction. Multi-sample anti aliasing is enabled for
smoother rendering.
