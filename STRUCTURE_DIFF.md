# Structure Diff

The repository tree was compared against `docs/structure.md`. No major deviations were found except for the following items:

- `logs/` directory contains runtime logs and is not documented in `structure.md`.
- Audit artifacts (`AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `QUALITY_SCORECARD.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md`, `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`, `STRUCTURE_DIFF.md`, `TERMS_MIGRATION.md`) are new and not reflected in the structure guide.

All core folders such as `sage_engine/`, `docs/`, `examples/`, `tests/`, and `tools/` match the documented structure.
