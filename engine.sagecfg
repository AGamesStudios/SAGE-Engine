# Example engine configuration
# Order of agent registration matters for correct phase execution.
# Agents are initialized sequentially in boot phase and then participate in
# update → draw → flush → shutdown cycles. Recommended order:
# 1. InputAgent
# 2. AIProcessingAgent
# 3. PhysicsAgent
# 4. RenderAgent
# 5. ResourceAgent

# Actual modules can be listed in the "modules" key if needed.
# modules = ["input", "render", "resource"]
