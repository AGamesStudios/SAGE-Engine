# Terms Migration

Search across the repository confirmed that runtime modules do not use the term *Agent*. The only occurrence is inside `tools/enforce_terms.py`, which checks for forbidden terminology.

All documentation refers to runtime components as **systems**. The previous `docs/AGENTS.md` was removed and replaced with contributor guidelines.
