# Demo Game

This minimal example boots the engine, creates a sprite and plays a sound.

## Running on Windows

1. Install Python 3.10â€“3.12.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -e .`.
3. Launch `python demo.py` from this directory.

Set the environment variable `SAGE_LOGLEVEL=DEBUG` to see detailed logs.
If `start.wav` is missing, the game prints a warning but continues.
