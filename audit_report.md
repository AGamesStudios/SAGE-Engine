# Audit Report: SAGE Engine

## Module Implementation Status

| Module | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| core | Implemented | Provides boot/tick/reset/shutdown with module loading from `engine.json` |
| dag | Implemented | Supports dependency ordering and cycle detection |
| scheduler.time | Implemented | Maintains delta time and frame count |
| scheduler.timers | Partially implemented | Timer manager works, but `boot()` stub is empty |
| events | Partially implemented | Dispatcher works, but `boot()` and `update()` are empty |
| blueprint | Implemented | Handles JSON load and migration |
| compat | Implemented | Registers migration functions |
| roles | Implemented | Loads JSON role schemas and generates docs |
| world | Partially implemented | Core scene logic present; `boot()` and `update()` are placeholders |
| render | Partially implemented | Minimal prepare/sort/flush pipeline |
| resource | Partially implemented | Async loader stub |
| tasks | Partially implemented | Scheduler exists, but `boot()` is empty |
| profiling | Implemented | Holds counters for profiling |
| plugins | Implemented | Loads Python modules from `plugins/` |
| game_state | Implemented | Simple stack based state manager |
| audio | Partially implemented | `play()` is placeholder |
| shaders | Partially implemented | `Effect.apply()` placeholder |
| settings | Implemented | Provides global settings |
| devtools (CLI & config) | Implemented | Provides command line utilities |
| flow (python/lua) | Absent | Empty modules |
| ui | Missing | Listed in `engine.json` but package not present |

## Detected Placeholders and TODOs

- Empty `boot()` and `update()` functions in `world` module【F:sage_engine/world/__init__.py†L188-L194】.
- Empty `boot()` and `update()` in `events` module【F:sage_engine/events/__init__.py†L48-L53】.
- Empty `boot()` in timer manager【F:sage_engine/scheduler/timers.py†L59-L64】.
- Empty `boot()` in tasks system【F:sage_engine/tasks/__init__.py†L51-L56】.
- `Audio.play()` stub with no implementation【F:sage_engine/audio/__init__.py†L11-L13】.
- `Effect.apply()` stub in shaders module【F:sage_engine/shaders/__init__.py†L9-L11】.
- `visual.compare_screenshot` has TODO for screenshot diffing【F:sage_testing/visual.py†L1-L7】.
- `devtools/generate_roles.py` described as "Simple role code generator (stub)" with minimal logic【F:sage_engine/devtools/generate_roles.py†L1-L22】.
- Empty `flow.python` and `flow.lua` packages.

## Documentation Issues

- No dedicated documentation for the stable API decorator; only brief mention in `compatibility.md`【F:docs/compatibility.md†L11-L15】.
- `engine.json` lists module `ui` and `sprite`, but there is no `sage_engine.ui` package and no module named `sprite`【F:engine.json†L3-L11】.
- Documentation references modules such as `ui`【F:docs/modules.md†L35-L35】 which are not implemented.

## Test Coverage Observations

- Unit tests cover core, DAG, events, timers, tasks, blueprint loading, compatibility, scene operations, role generation, plugins and time.
- No tests for render pipeline, resource loading, audio, game_state, shaders or async features.
- Visual testing placeholder not implemented.

## Overall Assessment

The repository lays out the skeleton of SAGE Engine with many subsystems defined. Basic functionality like role management, scene storage, event dispatching and timers are present with accompanying tests. However several modules remain stubs or partially implemented, notably audio, shaders, rendering, resource loading and task boot hooks. Some functions are placeholders marked with `pass`. The documentation largely matches the implemented modules but references missing components such as the `ui` package and lacks a complete guide for the stable API. `engine.json` also references modules that don't exist. The project has a good foundation but is not yet feature-complete.

**Architectural readiness score:** 6/10. The core concepts are in place but several modules and docs need completion and additional test coverage.

## Recommendations

1. Implement missing `ui` package or remove from `engine.json` and documentation.
2. Provide functional implementations for stub methods (`Audio.play`, `Effect.apply`, module boot functions) or clearly document them as future work.
3. Add tests for rendering, resource loading and asynchronous operations.
4. Expand documentation with a dedicated `stable_api.md` describing guaranteed interfaces.
5. Review `engine.json` to ensure listed modules correspond to actual packages (`profiling` vs `profiler`, `sprite` vs roles). Adjust module loader accordingly.
6. Flesh out the `flow` packages or remove until implemented.
7. Finish screenshot comparison logic in `sage_testing.visual` to enable graphical regression tests.
